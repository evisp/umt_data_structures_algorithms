# Binary Search Trees

## ðŸŒ³ Part 1: Understanding a Given Binary Search Tree (BST)

Given the following **Binary Search Tree diagram**, answer the questions below:

```
         8
       /   \
      3     10
     / \      \
    1   6      14
       / \     /
      4   7   13
```

#### Tree Properties

1. **What is the root of the tree?**

2. **List all the leaf nodes.**

3. **What is the height of the tree?**

4. **What is the depth of node `14`?**

5. **Which nodes are at level 2?**  
   *(Assume root is level 0)*

6. **How many internal (non-leaf) nodes are there?**

7. **What is the parent of node `7`?**

8. **Does this tree satisfy the Binary Search Tree property? Explain briefly.**

#### Tree Traversals 

9. **Write the In-order traversal of the tree.**

10. **Write the Pre-order traversal of the tree.**

11. **Write the Post-order traversal of the tree.**

## Building a Binary Search Tree in Java

In this task, you are working with a generic Binary Search Tree (BST). A BST is a binary tree where each node contains a value, and for every node:
- All values in the left subtree are less than the node's value.
- All values in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.

You will be working with the following generic `Node` class that represents each node in the tree:

```java
class Node<T extends Comparable<T>> {
    T data;
    Node<T> left, right;

    Node(T data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}
```

### Methods to Implement 

- `public void insert(T value)`  
  Adds a new value to the BST at the correct position. Values are placed according to the BST property, and duplicates are ignored.

- `public boolean contains(T value)`  
  Checks whether a given value exists in the tree. Returns `true` if found, `false` otherwise.

- `public void inOrderTraversal()`, `preOrderTraversal()`, `postOrderTraversal()`  
  Traverse and print the tree in different orders: in-order (LNR), pre-order (NLR), post-order (LRN). These help explore the structure and order of values.

- `public T findMin()`, `findMax()`  
  Return the minimum or maximum value in the BST. These are located by following the leftmost or rightmost paths from the root.

- `public int height()`  
  Computes the height of the tree: i.e., the length of the longest path from root to a leaf. An empty tree has a height of -1.

- `public int countNodes()`  
  Returns the total number of nodes in the tree by recursively counting all nodes.

- `public int countLeaves()`  
  Counts and returns how many leaf nodes (nodes with no children) are in the tree.

- `public int countInternalNodes()`  
  Returns the number of internal nodes: those that are not leaves and have at least one child.

- `public int getDepth(T value)`  
  Returns the depth (number of edges from the root) of a node with the given value. If the value is not found, returns -1.

- `public boolean isBalanced()`  
  Checks if the tree is height-balanced. A tree is balanced if no node has subtrees that differ in height by more than 1.

- `public void delete(T value)`  
  Removes a node with the given value from the tree. Handles three cases: node has no child, one child, or two children (in which case it uses the in-order successor).

- `public boolean isValidBST()`  
  Validates that the current structure satisfies the BST ordering property at every node.

- `public List<T> pathToNode(T value)`  
  Returns a list containing the path from the root to the specified value. If the value doesn't exist, returns an empty list.

- `public void printTree()`  
  Prints the structure of the tree in a readable visual format. Useful for debugging and visualizing the layout of the BST.

### Code to Visually Print the Tree

You may use the following code to print the tree in a nice way

```java
public void printTree() {
    printTreeRecursive(root, "", true);
}

private void printTreeRecursive(Node<T> node, String prefix, boolean isTail) {
    if (node == null) return;

    System.out.println(prefix + (isTail ? "â””â”€â”€ " : "â”œâ”€â”€ ") + node.data);

    if (node.left != null || node.right != null) {
        if (node.right != null) {
            printTreeRecursive(node.right, prefix + (isTail ? "    " : "â”‚   "), false);
        }
        if (node.left != null) {
            printTreeRecursive(node.left, prefix + (isTail ? "    " : "â”‚   "), true);
        }
    }
}
```
