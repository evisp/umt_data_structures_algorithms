## üå≥ Real-World Projects Using a Generic Binary Search Tree

We have [implemented](./sample_code/) a generic `BinarySearchTree<T>` in Java, which supports storing and managing any type `T` that implements `Comparable<T>`. Now it's time to apply this data structure to practical domains. Below are three real-world project scenarios where you can extend and adapt your BST implementation.

### Project Scenarios

1. **üõí Product Management System**  
   Manage a catalog of products sorted by name or price. Each product has fields like `name`, `price`, and `category`. Use the BST to efficiently insert, search, delete, and list products in sorted order.

2. **üéì Student Management System**  
   Maintain a student database where each student has attributes such as `idNumber`, `name`, and `GPA`. Use the BST to organize students based on id number or name, and support fast search and updates.

3. **üè¢ Employee Management System**  
   Track employees using a BST sorted by `employeeId` or `name`. Employees can have `department`, and `salary` as additional attributes. This system can support finding employees by ID, listing them alphabetically, or filtering by certain attributes.

## üí° Tips and Hints for Implementation

### 1. üì¶ Use the `Comparable` Interface

To store custom objects (like `Product`, `Student`, `Employee`) in your `BinarySearchTree<T>`, ensure those classes implement the `Comparable<T>` interface.

```java
public class Product implements Comparable<Product> {
    String name;
    double price;

    // rest of your code

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Product other) {
        return this.name.compareTo(other.name); // or compare by price
    }
}
```

### 2. üìÅ Load Data from a File

To test with large datasets, you can read data from a file and insert it into your BST. Here's a quick example:

```java
public static void loadProductsFromFile(BinarySearchTree<Product> bst, String filename) {
    try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(filename))) {
        while (sc.hasNextLine()) {
            String[] parts = sc.nextLine().split(",");
            String name = parts[0];
            double price = Double.parseDouble(parts[1]);
            Product product = new Product(name, price);
            bst.insert(product);
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

File format (`products.txt`):
```
Laptop,999.99
Smartphone,499.49
Tablet,299.99
```

### 3. Use Existing BST Operations

You are encouraged to use existing tree methods such as:
- `insert(T value)`
- `contains(T value)`
- `delete(T value)`
- `inOrderTraversal()` for sorted listings
- `findMin()` / `findMax()` for boundary analysis
- `height()` / `isBalanced()` for performance insights

### 4. Optional Enhancements

- Add filters (e.g., all products above a certain price)
- Allow sorting by different fields
- Export the tree to a file or visualize it using `printTree()`
