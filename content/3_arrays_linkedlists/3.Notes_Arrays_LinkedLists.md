# âœ… **Week 3: Arrays and Linked Lists**  

## Arrays
An array is a fundamental data structure that stores elements in a contiguous block of memory. Each element in an array is accessed using an index, which allows for constant-time (`O(1)`) retrieval. However, arrays have fixed sizes, which can lead to wasted memory or the need for resizing when the number of elements exceeds the allocated space.

### Types of Arrays
- **Static Arrays:** The size of the array is defined at the time of creation and cannot be changed. These arrays provide efficient indexing but may lead to unused memory if not fully occupied.
- **Dynamic Arrays:** Unlike static arrays, dynamic arrays can grow or shrink as needed. They automatically allocate new memory and copy existing elements when resized, ensuring flexibility in managing data.

### Example:
#### Static Array in Java:
```java
int[] staticArray = new int[5]; // Fixed size, cannot be resized
```
#### Dynamic Array in Java (ArrayList):
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
ArrayList<Integer> dynamicArray = new ArrayList<>(); // Can grow dynamically
dynamicArray.add(10);
dynamicArray.add(20);
```

## Linked Lists
A linked list is a dynamic data structure where elements, called nodes, are linked together using pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a contiguous block of memory, making them more flexible when frequent insertions and deletions are needed. Each node in a linked list consists of two parts:
1. **Data:** The actual value stored in the node.
2. **Pointer:** A reference to the next node (or both next and previous nodes in doubly linked lists).

### Types of Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List:** Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Traversal is unidirectional, meaning it can only move forward.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node, allowing movement in both directions.
- **Circular Linked List:** The last node of the list links back to the first node, forming a circular structure. It can be singly or doubly linked.

## Comparing Arrays and Linked Lists
Both arrays and linked lists are essential for different use cases, depending on access patterns and memory management requirements.

| Feature           | Arrays                | Linked Lists          |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Memory Usage     | Contiguous, may waste space | Dynamic, uses extra space for pointers |
| Access Time      | `O(1)` (direct indexing) | `O(n)` (traversal required) |
| Insertion        | `O(n)` (shifting required) | `O(1)` at the beginning, `O(n)` elsewhere |
| Deletion         | `O(n)` (shifting required) | `O(1)` at the beginning, `O(n)` elsewhere |
| Searching        | `O(n)`, `O(log n)` (if sorted) | `O(n)` |

### When to Use:
- **Use arrays** when you need fast random access and a fixed-size structure.
- **Use linked lists** when insertions and deletions are frequent, and memory reallocation needs to be avoided.
