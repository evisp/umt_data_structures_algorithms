# Sorting Algorithm Performance Analysis
  
In this task, you will analyze the performance of different sorting algorithms by measuring their execution time on arrays of various sizes.  

## Given Sorting Algorithms  
You are provided with [implementations](./sample_code/lecture/SortingAlgorithms.java) of the following sorting algorithms:  
- **Bubble Sort**  
- **Selection Sort**  
- **Insertion Sort**  
- **Quick Sort**  
- **Merge Sort**  

### Measure Sorting Time for a Large Array  

1. Generate a large **random array** say with **10,000 elements**.  
2. Use each sorting algorithm to sort the array.  
3. Measure and record the time taken by each algorithm.  
4. Print the time taken for each sorting method.  

ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** Use the `System.nanoTime()` method to record execution time.  

```java
long startTime = System.nanoTime();
SortingAlgorithms.bubbleSort(array);
long endTime = System.nanoTime();

long duration = (endTime - startTime) / 1_000_000; // Convert to milliseconds
System.out.println("Bubble Sort Time: " + duration + " ms");
```

### Experiment with Different Array Sizes
Repeat the experiment for different array sizes, such as: 10,000 elements, 50,000 elements, 100,000 elements, or even more. For each size, record and compare the execution time of all sorting algorithms.

### Key insights

- Which algorithm is the fastest? Why?
- Which algorithm is the slowest? Why?
- How does the performance of each algorithm change as the array size increases?
- What trends do you observe in the timing results?

# Timsort Algorithm

Understand the **Timsort** algorithm, which is the default sorting algorithm in Java, and highlight its key features.

### 1. Research Timsort  
- Briefly explain **why Timsort** is used as the default algorithm in Java.  
- Describe its **key idea** in simple terms (hybrid of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort).  
- Mention its **advantages** (adaptive, stable, efficient for partially sorted data).

### 2. Pseudocode  
- Write a **pseudocode** for Timsort, focusing on:  
  1. Identifying sorted runs in the array.  
  2. Merging the runs using a merge strategy.
  3. **Bonus:** Implement Timsort in Java if possible!

# Bank System Improvement

## Context
In the last session, we developed a simple bank management system. The system currently has a base structure with `Transaction`, `BankAccount`, `Customer`, and `BankQueue` classes, but it lacks important functionalities for managing and searching customers efficiently.

You can find the base code in the [this directory](./sample_code/seminar/)


## Requirements

### 1. **Create the `Bank` Class**
Develop a `Bank` class that will store and manage a **list of customers**. The class should:
- Maintain an internal list of `Customer` objects.
- Provide methods to **add**, **search**, and **sort** customers.

### 2. **Implement Sorting and Searching Operations**
- **Sorting:**
  - Implement `sortCustomersByName()`, which sorts customers **alphabetically by name** using **Merge Sort**.
- **Searching:**
  - Implement `findCustomerByName(String name)`, which searches for a customer **using Binary Search**.
  - If the customer exists, return the `Customer` object; otherwise, return `null`.

### 3. **Implement a Method to Get Total Customers**
- Implement `getTotalCustomers()`, which returns the **total number of customers** in the bank.

### 4. **Method to Read Customers from a File**
- You are provided a method which reads customers' data from a file. Method `readCustomersFromFile(String filename)` reads the data and stores them in a list. 

### 5. **Write `main` to Test Functionalities**
Modify or write the `main` method to:
- Create a `Bank` instance.
- Load customers from `customers.txt`.
- Sort the customers.
- Search for a customer and display their details.
- Print the total number of customers.

For example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Bank bank = new Bank();
    bank.readCustomersFromFile("customers.txt");
    
    System.out.println("Total Customers: " + bank.getTotalCustomers());
    
    bank.sortCustomersByName();
    Customer found = bank.findCustomerByName("Alice");
    
    if (found != null) {
        System.out.println("Customer Found: " + found.getName() + ", Balance: " + found.getBankAccount().getBalance());
    } else {
        System.out.println("Customer not found.");
    }
}
```
