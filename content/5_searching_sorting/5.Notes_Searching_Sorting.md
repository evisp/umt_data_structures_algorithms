# ✅ **Week 5: Searching and Sorting Algorithms**

  


## **Searching Algorithms**  
Searching algorithms help find an item in a dataset quickly and efficiently. There are two main types: **sequential searching**, which checks each item one by one, and **divide-and-conquer searching**, which splits the data to narrow down the search faster. The choice of algorithm depends on how the data is organized and how fast you need the search to be. The two primary types are:  

### **Linear Search** (Brute Force)  
Linear Search is the simplest search method. It scans each element in an array **one by one** until it finds the target.  

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` (worst case)  
- **Best for:** Small or unsorted datasets  
- **Key Idea:** Works like looking for a misplaced item by checking every spot.  

**Example Use Case:** Searching for an employee's ID in an **unsorted** database.  

### **Binary Search** (Divide & Conquer)  
Binary Search works **only on sorted arrays**. It repeatedly divides the search space in half until the target is found.  

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`  
- **Best for:** Large, sorted datasets  
- **Key Idea:** Similar to looking up a word in a dictionary—jump to the middle, decide left or right, repeat.  

**Example Use Case:** Finding a customer record in a **sorted** employee database.

## **Sorting Algorithms**  
Sorting arranges elements in **ascending or descending** order, making searching and data retrieval more efficient.  

### **Bubble Sort** (Brute Force)  
Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order, repeatedly passing through the list.  

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)` (slow for large datasets)  
- **Key Idea:** Like bubbles in water, larger elements "float" to the end.  
- **Best for:** Small or nearly sorted data.  

**Example Use Case:** Sorting a small list of student test scores.  

### **Selection Sort** (Brute Force)  
Finds the smallest element and moves it to its correct position, repeating for all elements.  

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`  
- **Key Idea:** Like selecting the smallest playing card and placing it in order.  
- **Best for:** When memory is limited (requires minimal swaps).  

**Example Use Case:** Organizing a leaderboard for a local competition.  

### **Insertion Sort** (Efficient for Small Data)  
Takes elements one by one and inserts them in the correct position in a growing sorted section.  

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)` (but `O(n)` if already sorted)  
- **Key Idea:** Like sorting a hand of playing cards by inserting each new card in the right spot.  
- **Best for:** Small datasets or nearly sorted data.  

**Example Use Case:** Sorting a **small** list of employees by joining date.  

### **Merge Sort** (Divide & Conquer)  
Recursively divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back together.  

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`  
- **Key Idea:** Like dividing a messy room into sections, tidying each, and combining.  
- **Best for:** Large datasets when stability (preserving order of equal elements) matters.  

**Example Use Case:** Sorting a **large** set of customer records for batch processing.  

### **Quick Sort** (Divide & Conquer)  
Picks a pivot, partitions elements around it, then recursively sorts the partitions.  

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` (average) but `O(n²)` (worst case if poorly chosen pivots).  
- **Key Idea:** Like arranging items around a reference point (e.g., sorting books by height).  
- **Best for:** Large datasets where performance is key.  

**Example Use Case:** Optimizing database query results for fast retrieval.

## **Comparing Sorting Algorithms**  

| Sorting Algorithm | Strategy         | Time Complexity | Best Use Case |
|------------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Bubble Sort**  | Brute Force     | `O(n²)`      | Small/Nearly sorted data |
| **Selection Sort** | Brute Force  | `O(n²)`      | Memory-limited sorting |
| **Insertion Sort** | Incremental | `O(n²)` but `O(n)` for nearly sorted | Small datasets |
| **Merge Sort**   | Divide & Conquer | `O(n log n)` | Large & stable sorting |
| **Quick Sort**   | Divide & Conquer | `O(n log n)` avg, `O(n²)` worst | General-purpose fast sorting |

### **When to Use:**  
- **Use Linear Search** if the data is **unsorted or small**.  
- **Use Binary Search** if the data is **sorted and large**.  
- **Use Bubble or Selection Sort** only for **small datasets**.  
- **Use Merge Sort** when **stability is required**.  
- **Use Quick Sort** for **fast, in-place sorting**.
