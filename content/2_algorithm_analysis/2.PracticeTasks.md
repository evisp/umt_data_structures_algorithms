#  **Algorithm Design Strategies - Student Presentations**  

## 📢 **Presentation Guidelines**  
Selected students will prepare a **5-minute presentation** on one of the algorithmic problems listed below. The goal is to **explain why the problem fits within a specific algorithm design strategy** rather than focusing on code implementation. In addition, you will be asked to provide a key strategy to address / solve that problem.  

### **Presentation Requirements:**  
✔ **Slides:** 3 to 5 slides maximum.  
✔ **Code:** No actual code—only pseudocode if necessary.  
✔ **Key Focus:** Explain why the problem aligns with the given strategy.  
✔ **Clarity:** Keep it simple, clear, and easy to follow.

## 📝 **List of Topics**  

### 🔹 **Brute Force**  
🔹 **[Subset Sum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subset-sum-problem-dp-25/) Problem**  
   - **Problem:** Given a set of numbers and a target sum, determine if there exists a subset whose sum equals the target.  
   - **Example:** For the set `{3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}` and target `9`, a subset `{4, 5}` adds up to `9`.  

🔹 **[String Matching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/naive-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/) (Naïve Algorithm)**  
   - **Problem:** Given a text and a pattern, find if the pattern appears in the text.  
   - **Example:** For `text = "hello algorithms"` and `pattern = "algorithm"`, check every possible position in `"hello algorithms"` to see if `"algorithm"` matches.

### 🔹 **Divide and Conquer**  
🔹 **Merge Sort**  
   - **Problem:** Sort an array by following the [merge sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/) algorithm, whose key idea is to sort an array by dividing it into halves, sorting each half, and merging them.  
   - **Example:** Sorting `[8, 3, 5, 2]` → Divide into `[8, 3]` and `[5, 2]`, sort both (`[3, 8]` and `[2, 5]`), and merge into `[2, 3, 5, 8]`.  
 
🔹 **Binary Search**  
   - **Problem:** Find an element in a sorted array by employing the [binary search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/) approach, that is by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.  
   - **Example:** Search for `5` in `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`. Start with the middle element `5` → Found!

### 🔹 **Recursion**  
🔹 **Compute the Factorial**  
   - **Problem:** Use a recursive approach to calculate `n!` where `n! = n × (n-1) × ... × 1`.  
   - **Example:** `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`.

### 🔹 **Greedy Algorithms**  
🔹 **[Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/) (Greedy Version)**  
   - **Problem:** Given coins of different denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed.  
   - **Example:** If available coins are `{1, 5, 10, 25}` and the target is `37`, a greedy approach picks `25 + 10 + 1 + 1`, using **4 coins**.
