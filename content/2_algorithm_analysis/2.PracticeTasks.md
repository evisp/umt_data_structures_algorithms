#  **Algorithm Design Strategies - Student Presentations**  

## üì¢ **Presentation Guidelines**  
Selected students will prepare a **5-minute presentation** on one of the algorithmic problems listed below. The goal is to **explain why the problem fits within a specific algorithm design strategy** rather than focusing on code implementation. In addition, you will be asked to provide a key strategy to address / solve that problem.  

### **Presentation Requirements:**  
‚úî **Slides:** 3 to 5 slides maximum.  
‚úî **Code:** No actual code‚Äîonly pseudocode if necessary.  
‚úî **Key Focus:** Explain why the problem aligns with the given strategy.  
‚úî **Clarity:** Keep it simple, clear, and easy to follow.

## üìù **List of Topics**  

### **Brute Force**  

**[Subset Sum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subset-sum-problem-dp-25/) Problem**  
   - **Problem:** Given a set of numbers and a target sum, determine if there exists a subset whose sum equals the target.  
   - **Example:** For the set `{3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}` and target `9`, a subset `{4, 5}` adds up to `9`.  

**[String Matching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/naive-algorithm-for-pattern-searching/) (Na√Øve Algorithm)**  
   - **Problem:** Given a text and a pattern, find if the pattern appears in the text.  
   - **Example:** For `text = "hello algorithms"` and `pattern = "algorithm"`, check every possible position in `"hello algorithms"` to see if `"algorithm"` matches.

### **Divide and Conquer**  
**Merge Sort**  
   - **Problem:** Sort an array by following the [merge sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/) algorithm, whose key idea is to sort an array by dividing it into halves, sorting each half, and merging them.  
   - **Example:** Sorting `[8, 3, 5, 2]` ‚Üí Divide into `[8, 3]` and `[5, 2]`, sort both (`[3, 8]` and `[2, 5]`), and merge into `[2, 3, 5, 8]`.  
 
**Binary Search**  
   - **Problem:** Find an element in a sorted array by employing the [binary search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/) approach, that is by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.  
   - **Example:** Search for `5` in `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`. Start with the middle element `5` ‚Üí Found!

### **Recursion**  
**Compute the Factorial**  
   - **Problem:** Use a recursive approach to calculate `n!` where `n! = n √ó (n-1) √ó ... √ó 1`.  
   - **Example:** `5! = 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1 = 120`.   

---

### **Greedy Algorithms**  

**[Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/) (Greedy Version)**  
   - **Problem:** Given coins of different denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed.  
   - **Example:** If available coins are `{1, 5, 10, 25}` and the target is `37`, a greedy approach picks `25 + 10 + 1 + 1`, using **4 coins**.

# Sorting Algorithm Performance Analysis

In this exercise, you will measure the execution times of **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Merge Sort** for various input sizes. 

**You do not need to fully understand the code at this point**

You will analyze the results both **experimentally** (by running the code) and **theoretically** (by considering the known complexities of these algorithms). Finally, you will compare the experimental times to the theoretical complexities.

## Guidelines

### 1. **Prepare the Environment and Run the Code**
- Ensure you have all the files in the `[sample_code](./sample_code/)` folder.
- You will measure the execution time of each sorting algorithm for different input sizes.
- The `Main.java` file contains the logic to test all four sorting algorithms.
    - The program will print the execution time for **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Merge Sort** for different array sizes (1000, 10000, 100000, etc).

### 2. **Analyze the Results Experimentally**
- Record the times printed for each sorting algorithm.
- Compare how the time changes as the input size increases.
- Take note of any trends in the execution times for each algorithm.

3. **Theoretical Complexity:**
   - Review the theoretical time complexities of **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Merge Sort**.
   - Predict how the times should behave based on these complexities.

4. **Compare Experimental and Theoretical Results:**
   - Does the increase in time for **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Insertion Sort** match the expected quadratic growth ($O(n^2)$)?
   - Does the increase in time for **Merge Sort** match the expected logarithmic growth ($O(n log n)$)?
