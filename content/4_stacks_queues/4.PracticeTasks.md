# Banking System Application Requirements 

## Overview
This project involves building a simple banking system that simulates account transactions and customer service management. The application consists of multiple classes that represent different aspects of a banking environment, including:

- **Customer**: Represents a bank customer.
- **Transaction**: Represents individual transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **BankAccount**: Manages a customer's bank account, including handling deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history.
- **BankQueue**: Manages a queue of customers waiting for service.
- **Main Program**: Demonstrates the usage of the banking system through testing the developed methods.

A **skeleton code** is provided in the `sample_code` folder, containing predefined structures and fully implemented `Customer` and `Transaction` classes.
