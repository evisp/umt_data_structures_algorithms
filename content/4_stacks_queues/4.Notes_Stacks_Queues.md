# âœ… **Week 4: Stacks and Queues**  

## Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. This means that the last element added is the first one to be removed, much like a stack of plates in a cafeteria.

### Operations on a Stack
Stacks support three primary operations:
- **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- **Peek (or Top):** Retrieves the top element without removing it.

### Example: Stack in Java (Using `Stack` Class)
```java
import java.util.Stack;

Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
stack.push(10);
stack.push(20);
System.out.println(stack.pop()); // Removes and prints 20
System.out.println(stack.peek()); // Prints 10, but does not remove it
```

### Applications of Stacks
Stacks are used in many applications, including:
- **Undo/Redo functionality** in text editors.
- **Expression evaluation** (e.g., converting infix to postfix notation).
- **Backtracking algorithms**, such as solving mazes or navigating browser history.

## Queues
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. The first element added is the first one to be removed, similar to people standing in a queue.

### Types of Queues
- **Simple Queue:** Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
- **Circular Queue:** The last position connects back to the first to utilize space efficiently.
- **Deque (Double-ended Queue):** Elements can be added or removed from both ends.
- **Priority Queue:** Elements are dequeued based on priority rather than order.

### Operations on a Queue
Queues support these operations:
- **Enqueue:** Adds an element to the rear.
- **Dequeue:** Removes and returns the front element.
- **Peek (or Front):** Retrieves the front element without removing it.

### Example: Queue in Java (Using `LinkedList`)
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
queue.add(10);
queue.add(20);
System.out.println(queue.remove()); // Removes and prints 10
System.out.println(queue.peek()); // Prints 20, but does not remove it
```

### Applications of Queues
Queues are used in:
- **Task scheduling**, such as CPU scheduling in operating systems.
- **Printer spooling**, where print jobs are managed in order.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** in graph algorithms.

## Comparing Stacks and Queues

| Feature         | Stack (LIFO)         | Queue (FIFO)         |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Order of Removal | Last element first | First element first |
| Access Time    | `O(1)` for push/pop  | `O(1)` for enqueue/dequeue |
| Usage         | Backtracking, recursion | Scheduling, BFS, resource sharing |

### When to Use:
- **Use stacks** when the order of operations requires backtracking.
- **Use queues** when processing elements in the order they arrive is necessary.
