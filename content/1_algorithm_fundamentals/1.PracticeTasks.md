# Algorithmic Thinking Tasks

## Introduction
In this series of tasks, you will focus on writing **pseudocode** to solve problems efficiently. The emphasis is on understanding algorithms, analyzing their complexity, and thinking about optimizations. 

## General Instructions
- Write clear and structured pseudocode.
- Analyze the time complexity of your solution.
- Think about possible optimizations.
- Discuss different approaches where applicable.

## Example Task: Searching for an Element in a List

**Problem:** Given a list of numbers and a target value, write a pseudocode algorithm to check if the target exists in the list. If found, return its position; otherwise, return `-1`.

**Pseudocode Solution:**
```plaintext
Algorithm SearchElement(list, target)
    For i from 0 to length(list) - 1 do
        If list[i] == target then
            Return i  // Found at index i
    End For
    Return -1  // Not found
End Algorithm
```
**Complexity Analysis:** This algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, as it may need to check every element in the worst case.

## Think Like a Programmer

### Task 1: Finding the Minimum Value in a List
Given a list of numbers, write a pseudocode algorithm to find and return the smallest number.

#### **Pseudocode:**
```
FUNCTION findMin(list)
    minValue ← list[0]  // Assume first element is the smallest
    FOR each number in list
        IF number < minValue THEN
            minValue ← number  // Update min if a smaller value is found
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    RETURN minValue
END FUNCTION
```
#### **Explanation:**
- Initialize `minValue` with the first element of the list.
- Loop through each element in the list and compare it with `minValue`.
- If a smaller number is found, update `minValue`.
- At the end of the loop, return the smallest number found.

### Task 2: Counting Occurrences of a Number
Given a list of numbers and a target number, count how many times the target appears in the list.

#### **Pseudocode:**
```
FUNCTION countOccurrences(list, target)
    count ← 0
    FOR each number in list
        IF number = target THEN
            count ← count + 1  // Increment count if number matches target
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    RETURN count
END FUNCTION
```
#### **Explanation:**
- Initialize `count` to 0.
- Loop through each number in the list and check if it matches the target.
- If it matches, increment `count`.
- Return the final count after checking all elements.

---

### Task 3: Checking if a List is Sorted
Given a list of numbers, write a pseudocode algorithm to check whether the list is sorted in ascending order.

#### **Pseudocode:**
```
FUNCTION isSorted(list)
    FOR i ← 0 TO length(list) - 2
        IF list[i] > list[i + 1] THEN
            RETURN false  // If a number is greater than the next, the list is not sorted
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    RETURN true  // If no issues found, the list is sorted
END FUNCTION
```
#### **Explanation:**
- Loop through the list and compare each element with the next one.
- If any element is greater than the next, return `false` immediately.
- If the loop completes without issues, return `true` (list is sorted).

### Task 4: Tracking the Most Frequent Word in a Document
Given a list of words from a document, write a pseudocode algorithm to determine which word appears the most frequently.

#### **Pseudocode:**
```
FUNCTION mostFrequentWord(words)
    wordCount ← empty dictionary
    maxWord ← ""
    maxCount ← 0
    
    FOR each word in words
        IF word exists in wordCount THEN
            wordCount[word] ← wordCount[word] + 1
        ELSE
            wordCount[word] ← 1
        ENDIF
        
        IF wordCount[word] > maxCount THEN
            maxCount ← wordCount[word]
            maxWord ← word
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    RETURN maxWord
END FUNCTION
```
#### **Explanation:**
- Use a dictionary to store word counts.
- Iterate through the words, updating their count in the dictionary.
- Keep track of the word with the highest count.
- Return the most frequent word after iterating through the list.

### Task 5: Reversing a List
Given a list of numbers, write a pseudocode algorithm to reverse the order of the elements in the list.

For example:
- **Input:** `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- **Output:** `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

#### **Pseudocode:**
```
FUNCTION reverseList(list)
    left ← 0
    right ← length(list) - 1
    WHILE left < right
        SWAP list[left] and list[right]
        left ← left + 1
        right ← right - 1
    ENDWHILE
    RETURN list
END FUNCTION
```
#### **Explanation:**
- Use two pointers: `left` at the start and `right` at the end.
- Swap elements at `left` and `right`, then move `left` forward and `right` backward.
- Continue until `left` meets `right`.
- The list is now reversed and returned.

## Understanding Time and Space Complexity

When designing algorithms, it's crucial to understand how their performance scales as the input size grows. **Time complexity** refers to how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the input size increases, while **space complexity** refers to how the memory usage grows.

### Key Complexity Classes:
1. **$O(1)$ - Constant Time**: The algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size.
2. **$O(n)$ - Linear Time**: The algorithm’s runtime grows linearly with the input size.
3. **$O(log n)$ - Logarithmic Time**: The algorithm’s runtime grows logarithmically as the input size increases.
4. **$O(n^2)$ - Quadratic Time**: The algorithm’s runtime grows quadratically as the input size increases (often due to nested loops).

## Analyzing Code Complexity

Below are code snippets in *different programming languages*. For each snippet, determine the **time complexity**.

### Task 1: Return the First Element in a List
```java
public static int getFirstElement(int[] arr) {
    return arr[0];
}
```

This function retrieves the first element of an array, which is a constant-time operation because it directly accesses an index without iteration or recursion. Regardless of the array's size, the execution time remains the same. Therefore, the time complexity is **O(1) (constant time)**, as it does not scale with the input size.


### Task 2: Print Elements of a List
```python
def print_elements(arr):
    for element in arr:
        print(element)
```

This function iterates through the entire list and prints each element, meaning the number of operations grows linearly with the input size. If the list has \( n \) elements, the loop runs \( n \) times, making the time complexity **O(n) (linear time)**.


### Task 3: Perform Search on a Sorted List
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

void binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = size - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            printf("Found at index %d\n", mid);
            return;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
}
```

This function implements **binary search**, which repeatedly divides the search range in half. Since the search space reduces by a factor of 2 in each iteration, the number of steps required is proportional to \( \log n \). Thus, the time complexity is **O(log n) (logarithmic time)**, making it highly efficient for searching in sorted lists.


### Task 4: Print All Pairs of Elements in a List
```javascript
function printPairs(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j = j + 100) {
            console.log(arr[i], arr[j]);
        }
    }
}
```

This function iterates through all elements with an outer loop and a nested inner loop that increments by 100. In the worst case, the inner loop runs approximately \( O(n/100) \) times for each iteration of the outer loop, resulting in an overall complexity of **O(n²)** in general cases. However, due to the step size of 100, the effective number of iterations is reduced, making it closer to **O(n² / 100) = O(n²)** in asymptotic terms, as constants are ignored in Big-O notation.

### Task 5: Check if the First Element is Even
```python
def is_first_element_even(arr):
    return arr[0] % 2 == 0
```

This function directly accesses the first element of the list and performs a single modulo operation, both of which take constant time. Since the execution time does not depend on the size of the input list, the time complexity is **O(1) (Constant Time)**.

### Task 6: Sum All Elements in a List
```c
void sumElements(int arr[], int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
}
```

This function iterates through the entire array once, summing all elements. Since the loop runs **size** times (where **size** is the number of elements in the array), the execution time grows linearly with the input size. Thus, the time complexity is **O(n) (Linear Time)**.

### Task 7: Sort a List 
```python
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

The time complexity of the `bubbleSort` algorithm is **O(n²)** in the worst and average cases, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because there are two nested loops: the outer loop runs `n` times, and the inner loop runs `n-i-1` times for each iteration of the outer loop.

The best-case complexity is **O(n)** when the array is already sorted, as the algorithm can detect no swaps and terminate early with an optimized version.

Space complexity is **O(1)**, as the sorting is done in place without using extra memory.

### Task 8: Find the Maximum Value in a List
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void findMax(int arr[], int size) {
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    printf("Max value: %d\n", max);
}
```

The time complexity of the `findMax` function is **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array. This is because the function iterates through the array once to compare each element and find the maximum.

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for the `max` variable and the loop index.
