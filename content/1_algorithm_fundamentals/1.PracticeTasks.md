# Algorithmic Thinking Tasks

## Introduction
In this series of tasks, you will focus on writing **pseudocode** to solve problems efficiently. The emphasis is on understanding algorithms, analyzing their complexity, and thinking about optimizations. 

## General Instructions
- Write clear and structured pseudocode.
- Analyze the time complexity of your solution.
- Think about possible optimizations.
- Discuss different approaches where applicable.

## Example Task: Searching for an Element in a List

**Problem:** Given a list of numbers and a target value, write a pseudocode algorithm to check if the target exists in the list. If found, return its position; otherwise, return `-1`.

**Pseudocode Solution:**
```plaintext
Algorithm SearchElement(list, target)
    For i from 0 to length(list) - 1 do
        If list[i] == target then
            Return i  // Found at index i
    End For
    Return -1  // Not found
End Algorithm
```
**Complexity Analysis:** This algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, as it may need to check every element in the worst case.

## Think Like a Programmer

### Task 1: Finding the Minimum Value in a List
Given a list of numbers, write a pseudocode algorithm to find and return the smallest number.

### Task 2: Counting Occurrences of a Number
Given a list of numbers and a target number, count how many times the target appears in the list.

### Task 3: Checking if a List is Sorted
Given a list of numbers, write a pseudocode algorithm to check whether the list is sorted in ascending order.


### Task 4: Tracking the Most Frequent Word in a Document
Given a list of words from a document, write a pseudocode algorithm to determine which word appears the most frequently.

### Task 5: Reversing a List
Given a list of numbers, write a pseudocode algorithm to reverse the order of the elements in the list.

For example:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Output: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

## Understanding Time and Space Complexity

When designing algorithms, it's crucial to understand how their performance scales as the input size grows. **Time complexity** refers to how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the input size increases, while **space complexity** refers to how the memory usage grows.

### Key Complexity Classes:
1. **O(1) - Constant Time**: The algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size.
2. **O(n) - Linear Time**: The algorithm’s runtime grows linearly with the input size.
3. **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time**: The algorithm’s runtime grows logarithmically as the input size increases.
4. **O(n^2) - Quadratic Time**: The algorithm’s runtime grows quadratically as the input size increases (often due to nested loops).

## Analyzing Code Complexity

Below are code snippets in *different programming languages*. For each snippet, determine the **time complexity**.

### Task 1: Return the First Element in a List
```java
public static int getFirstElement(int[] arr) {
    return arr[0];
}
```

### Task 2: Print Elements of a List
```python
def print_elements(arr):
    for element in arr:
        print(element)
```

### Task 3: Perform Search on a Sorted List
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

void binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = size - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            printf("Found at index %d\n", mid);
            return;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
}
```

### Task 4: Print All Pairs of Elements in a List
```javascript
function printPairs(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            console.log(arr[i], arr[j]);
        }
    }
}
```

### Task 5: Check if the First Element is Even
```python
def is_first_element_even(arr):
    return arr[0] % 2 == 0
```

### Task 6: Sum All Elements in a List
```c
void sumElements(int arr[], int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
}
```

### Task 7: Sort a List 
```python
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

### Task 8: Find the Maximum Value in a List
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void findMax(int arr[], int size) {
    int max = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    printf("Max value: %d\n", max);
}
```
