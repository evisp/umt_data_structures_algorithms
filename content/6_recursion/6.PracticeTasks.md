# Recursion

## Recursion in String 

### 1. Palindrome Checker
A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward. This is commonly used in text processing, data validation, and pattern searching. The task is to implement a recursive function that determines if a given string is a palindrome. 

**The function should take a string as input and return a boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome**. It should ignore case sensitivity and non-alphanumeric characters if necessary. The recursive approach should compare the first and last characters of the string and recursively check the remaining substring. 

**Example:**
```
Input: "racecar"
Output: true

Input: "hello"
Output: false
```

### 2. String Subsets (Combinations)

Generating all possible subsets of a string is useful in data analysis, test case generation, and combinatorics. The task is to **implement a recursive function that takes a string as input and prints all its subsets**. The function should handle both ordered and unordered subsets, ensuring no duplicate subsets are generated. The recursive approach should either include or exclude each character to form different subsets. 

**Example:**
```
Input: "abc"
Output: "", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"
``` 

## Recursion in Numbers

### 3. Sum of Digits
Calculating the sum of digits of a number is a common operation in checksum validation, digital root calculations, and cryptography. The task is to implement a recursive function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the sum of its digits. The function should repeatedly extract the last digit and add it to the sum of the remaining number until only a single-digit number is left.

**Example:**
```
Input: 1234
Output: 10

Input: 987
Output: 24
```

### 4. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
Computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) is essential in cryptography, network algorithms, and mathematical computations. The task is to implement a recursive function that calculates the GCD of two given numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function should repeatedly replace the larger number with the remainder of the division until one number becomes zero, at which point the other number is the GCD.

**Example:**
```
Input: (48, 18)
Output: 6

Input: (101, 103)
Output: 1
```

## Recursion in Puzzles

I've expanded the requirements for the **Sudoku Solver, Knight’s Tour, and N-Queens Puzzle** with clear explanations, constraints, and expected outputs. Let me know if you want to refine any part!

### **Sudoku Solver**  

Sudoku is a popular logic-based number placement puzzle. A valid Sudoku solution must satisfy the following conditions:  
- Each row must contain numbers `1-9` without repetition.  
- Each column must contain numbers `1-9` without repetition.  
- Each `3x3` sub-grid must contain numbers `1-9` without repetition.  

**Task:**  
Write a recursive function that takes a partially filled `9x9` Sudoku grid and fills in the missing numbers to produce a valid Sudoku solution. The function should follow these constraints:  
- A number can be placed in an empty cell only if it does not already exist in the corresponding row, column, and `3x3` sub-grid.  
- The function should explore possible values and backtrack when necessary.  
- The board should be solved in-place.  

**Example Input:**  
```
[
  [5,3,0, 0,7,0, 0,0,0],
  [6,0,0, 1,9,5, 0,0,0],
  [0,9,8, 0,0,0, 0,6,0],
  
  [8,0,0, 0,6,0, 0,0,3],
  [4,0,0, 8,0,3, 0,0,1],
  [7,0,0, 0,2,0, 0,0,6],
  
  [0,6,0, 0,0,0, 2,8,0],
  [0,0,0, 4,1,9, 0,0,5],
  [0,0,0, 0,8,0, 0,7,9]
]
```
**Expected Output (One Possible Solution):**  
```
[
  [5,3,4, 6,7,8, 9,1,2],
  [6,7,2, 1,9,5, 3,4,8],
  [1,9,8, 3,4,2, 5,6,7],
  
  [8,5,9, 7,6,1, 4,2,3],
  [4,2,6, 8,5,3, 7,9,1],
  [7,1,3, 9,2,4, 8,5,6],
  
  [9,6,1, 5,3,7, 2,8,4],
  [2,8,7, 4,1,9, 6,3,5],
  [3,4,5, 2,8,6, 1,7,9]
]
```

### **Knight's Tour**  

A classic problem in pathfinding and combinatorial puzzles. It models situations where a knight moves across a chessboard visiting every square exactly once.  

**Task:**  
Implement a recursive backtracking algorithm to find a sequence of moves that allows a knight (chess piece) to visit every cell exactly once on an `N × N` board. The knight moves in an "L" shape:  
- Two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular.  
- Moves must stay within board boundaries.  
- A solution is valid if the knight covers all `N^2` cells.  

**Constraints:**  
- The function should return the board with the knight’s move numbers.  
- If no solution exists, return an empty board or indicate failure.  

**Example Input:**  
```
N = 5
Starting position: (0,0)
```
**Expected Output (One Possible Solution):**  
```
[
  [ 1, 14,  3, 18, 11],
  [ 4, 19, 12,  7, 24],
  [15,  2, 17, 22,  9],
  [20,  5,  8, 13,  6],
  [23, 16, 21, 10, 25]
]
```
(The numbers represent the order in which the knight moves.)

### **N-Queens Puzzle**  
Used in constraint satisfaction problems, combinatorial search, and AI applications. The goal is to place `N` queens on an `N × N` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.  

**Task:**  
Write a recursive function to find all possible ways to place `N` queens on an `N × N` board, ensuring:  
- No two queens share the same row.  
- No two queens share the same column.  
- No two queens share the same diagonal.  
- The function should return all valid solutions.  

**Constraints:**  
- The function should return a list of valid board configurations.  
- If no solution exists, return an empty list.  

**Example Input:**  
```
N = 4
```
**Expected Output (Two Possible Solutions):**  
```
Solution 1:
[
  [".Q..",
   "...Q",
   "Q...",
   "..Q."]
]

Solution 2:
[
  ["..Q.",
   "Q...",
   "...Q",
   ".Q.."]
]
```
(Each `"Q"` represents a queen, and `"."` represents an empty square.)
