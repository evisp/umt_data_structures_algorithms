### ðŸŒ³ **Part 1: Understanding a Given Binary Search Tree (BST)**  

Given the following **Binary Search Tree diagram**, answer the questions below:

```
         8
       /   \
      3     10
     / \      \
    1   6      14
       / \     /
      4   7   13
```

#### Tree Properties

1. **What is the root of the tree?**

2. **List all the leaf nodes.**

3. **What is the height of the tree?**

4. **What is the depth of node `14`?**

5. **Which nodes are at level 2?**  
   *(Assume root is level 0)*

6. **How many internal (non-leaf) nodes are there?**

7. **What is the parent of node `7`?**

8. **Does this tree satisfy the Binary Search Tree property? Explain briefly.**

#### Tree Traversals 

9. **Write the In-order traversal of the tree.**

10. **Write the Pre-order traversal of the tree.**

11. **Write the Post-order traversal of the tree.**
