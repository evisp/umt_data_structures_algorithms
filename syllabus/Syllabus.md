# **Data Structures & Algorithms – Course Overview**  

This course provides a structured approach to understanding **data structures and algorithmic problem-solving** in Java. It begins with **fundamental concepts**, including **algorithm efficiency (Big-O notation), problem-solving strategies, and complexity classes**. 

The first half covers **arrays, lists, stacks, queues, recursion, and key searching/sorting algorithms**, leading up to a **midterm lab assessment**. The second half dives deep into **trees, heaps, and graphs**, followed by **real-world applications, optimization techniques, and performance tuning**. The course concludes with **project-oriented tasks, review sessions, and a final evaluation**.
