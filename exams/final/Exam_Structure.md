## Exam Structure

| Section                             | Points | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. True / False with Explanation**      | 5      | Conceptual questions to test understanding and identify common misconceptions. Brief explanations required. |
| **2. Code Output (Stacks, Queues, Lists)**| 8      | Analyze and trace code snippets involving stacks, queues, and lists. Predict outputs and provide concise explanations |
| **3. Key Concepts: Trees and Graphs**     | 8      | Interpret diagrams or scenarios related to trees and graphs. Questions may involve traversals, properties, or algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s and A-Star |
| **4. Key Algorithms (Pseudocode + Complexity)** | 15     | Write or complete pseudocode for algorithms related to recursion, searching, sorting, and graph/tree operations. Include time complexity analysis. |
| **5. Data Structure Selection for Use Cases** | 6      | Given practical scenarios, select the most appropriate data structure(s) and justify your choices. |
| **6. Coding Problem (LeetCode-style)** | 8      | Solve a (challenging) programming problem focusing on algorithmic design, correctness, and edge cases. |
