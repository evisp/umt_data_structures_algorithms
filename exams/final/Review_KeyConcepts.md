### True / False with Explanation — Sample Questions

Mark the following statements as `True` or `False`. Provide a concise explanation (1 - 2 sentences)

1. A recursive algorithm always uses more memory than its iterative equivalent.*

2.  Breadth-first search (BFS) can be used to find the shortest path in weighted graphs where all edges have equal weight.

3. The time complexity of binary search on any array is O(log n).

4. In a binary search tree (BST), the left subtree contains only nodes with keys less than the parent node’s key.

5. Dijkstra’s algorithm can be used to find the shortest path in graphs with negative edge weights.
