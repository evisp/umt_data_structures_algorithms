## **🔹 Project Options**  

### **🛍️ Option 1: Inventory Management System**  
A small business needs an **inventory management system** to efficiently handle products, process customer orders, and maintain stock levels. The system should support adding, updating, and removing products, as well as managing customer purchases and order corrections.  

**🔹 Tasks:**  
1. **Implement a linked list** to store product details (name, price, quantity) and allow dynamic inventory management.  
2. **Use a queue** (FIFO) to process customer orders in the order they were received.  
3. **Implement a stack** to track "undo" operations, allowing the business to reverse mistakenly placed orders.  
4. **Enable searching and sorting:**  
   - **Binary search** to quickly locate products by name.  
   - **Merge Sort** to efficiently sort products based on price.  
5. **Develop a recursive function** to calculate the total inventory value by summing the price of all available products.

### **🏫 Option 2: University Course Registration System**  
A university needs a **course registration system** to handle student enrollments, manage waiting lists, and track course availability efficiently. The system should support adding new courses, enrolling students, handling full courses, and allowing administrative corrections.  

**🔹 Tasks:**  
1. **Use a linked list** to store available courses, where each course contains a list of enrolled students.  
2. **Manage course enrollment:**  
   - **Queue for waitlisted students** (FIFO) to ensure fair order when a spot opens.  
   - **Stack for undoing** the last registration action, allowing quick corrections.  
3. **Implement searching and sorting:**  
   - **Binary search** to quickly locate a course by name.  
   - **Quick Sort** to organize courses based on the number of enrolled students.  
4. **Develop a recursive function** to calculate the total number of students enrolled across all courses.

### **🏥 Option 3: Hospital Patient Management System**  
A hospital requires a **patient management system** to efficiently handle patient records, prioritize critical cases, and streamline admissions and discharges. The system should support adding new patients, managing emergency cases, and tracking discharged patients.  

**🔹 Tasks:**  
1. **Implement a linked list** to store patient records, including name, condition, and severity score.  
2. **Manage patient processing:**  
   - **Priority queue** to ensure patients with higher severity are treated first.  
   - **Stack** to track discharged patients, allowing the last discharge to be undone if needed.  
3. **Implement searching and sorting:**  
   - **Binary search** to quickly locate a patient by name.  
   - **Merge Sort** to organize patients based on severity score.  
4. **Develop a recursive function** to compute the average severity score of all admitted patients.

### **🚖 Option 4: Ride-Sharing Queue System (Uber/Lyft Simulation)**  
A ride-sharing platform requires a **system to manage drivers and efficiently match them with riders**. The system should support adding and updating driver details, processing ride requests, handling cancellations, and maintaining driver ratings.  

**🔹 Tasks:**  
1. **Use a linked list** to store driver details, including name, rating, and current location.  
2. **Manage ride requests:**  
   - **Queue for pending ride requests** (FIFO) to ensure fair assignment.  
   - **Stack** to track ride cancellations, allowing the last cancellation to be undone if necessary.  
3. **Implement searching and sorting:**  
   - **Binary search** to quickly find a driver by name.  
   - **Quick Sort** to sort drivers based on their ratings.  
4. **Develop a recursive function** to compute the average driver rating across the system.  

---

## **🔹 Final Submission Requirements**  
- Code should be **fully functional** with **comments explaining logic**.  
- A **short report (1-2 pages)** explaining your implementation, challenges, and Big-O complexity of key operations.  
- If needed, you may prepare a **short presentation (a few slides)** to help explain your work during the exam.
